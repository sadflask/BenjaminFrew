  				<h1>Who Am I?</h1>

  				<h2>I Am a Game Developer</h2>

          <p>I have been passionate about games since I was little. I can still remember making games in intermediate school (probably when I should have been learning how to write essays), and how amazing it was to let my imagination run wild. There may have been turtles throwing ninja stars at some point. This enthusiasm has continued through to this day, and as I finish my Software Engineering degree at the University of Auckland, I spend much of my free time making and playing games.</p>
          <p>I have always been creative, and gaming has been a big part of my life in terms of expressing this creativity. While I have only really had one collaborative game development experience when developing Call of Booty (A pirate game made for a University course) I really look forward to coming together with other developers in the future. Below are some examples of games that i've worked on.</p>

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
            <h3>Space Shooter</h3>
            <img src="images/SpaceShooter.png"/>
            <p>The Space Shooter game is one from the Unity3D tutorials, which helped me to get a better grip on the game engine. The tutorial was really helpful when learning about things like lighting and coroutines.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
            <h3>Minesweeper</h3>
            <img src="images/MS.PNG"/>
            <p>Minesweeper has been a game that has always interested me, and i've had a few goes at coding it. While the first one was in Java, this one was made in Unity3D using C#, and I'm really happy with the result. I also thought the grass and dirt theme was a nice twist on a classic game.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <h3>Curling (In Development)</h3>
            <img src="images/curling.png"/>
            <p>This is the most technically difficult game of the three, and also the most tricky i've ever attempted to make. For those not familiar with curling, the stone rotates as it travels down the ice, causing very complicated physics interactions. I'm currently also coding this in C# in Unity3D, but may have to change depending on how well it handles the friction physics.</p>
          </div>

  				<h2>I Am a Web Developer</h2>
          <p>Another area that really interests me is Web Development and Web Design, particularly front-end Web Developement. While I have not had many opportunities for this, I have found the ones I have had very engaging, some of which are shown below.</p>

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
            <h3>This Website</h3>
            <img src="images/Website.png"/>
            <p>This website was made as a way to market myself to employers, as well as a place to keep a portfolio of my work. It was initally made from a template, but apart from the CSS all pages apart from the index are my own work.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="row-xs-12 col-xs-12 col-md-8">
            <h3>Deloitte Web App</h3>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6" style="padding-left: 0px;">
              <img src="images/Home.png"/>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6" style="padding-right: 0px;">
              <img src="images/Quiz.png"/>
            </div>
            <p>This website was made using the Ember.js framework, for a client as part of my Agile Development course at University. It was made by a team of 8 Engineers, but the screenshots shown are some of my work on it.</p><br><br>
          </div>

          <h1>What Else Do I Do?</h1>

          <h2>Sports</h2>
            I have played a sport in every single year since I was 5, playing up to 3 at one time. I really enjoy the team nature of some sports, and have been very close with my rugby, curling, and cricket teams over the years. I have also swum over the years, though this was mainly of a fitness perspective and less competitive than the other sports.<br>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
              <h3>Rugby</h3>
              <img src="images/Rugby.jpg"/>
              <p>Rugby has been my favourite sport since I was 5, playing every year except my first year of uni, where I coached instead. I like both the team culture generated by the game, and the successful feeling of combining the work of 15 people towards a common goal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
              <h3>Curling</h3>
              <img src="images/Curling.jpg"/>
              <p>Curling, however, is a more recent addiction of mine. It has been known to be called "Chess on Ice", and this intensely tatical aspect appeals to me. In addition to this, the team size is a lot smaller than in rugby (4-5 people) which allows you to be really close with your team mates.</p>
            </div>
          <h2>Gaming</h2>
            Similar to my interest in making games, I have always enjoyed playing games. These range from arcade style games like Tetris and Minesweeper, to Hearthstone, and even the Halo universe. If i'm not studying or playing sport, this is most likely where you'll find me. Listed below are my (current) favourite games.<br>
            <div class="col-xs-4 col-md-3">
              <h3>Hearthstone</h3>

            <div class="col-xs-4 col-md-3">
              <h3>Halo</h3>
