          <h1>Profile</h1>
          <p>I am a fourth-year Software Engineering student at the University of Auckland, looking to gain experience in the industry and grow my skills.
  During my degree, I have enjoyed both working on my own and in a team, learning the soft skills of teamwork, leadership, and good communication.
  In addition to this, I have gained the technical skills of Design Patterns, OOP, and good mathematical knowledge. This gives me a useful combination of technical and social skills.</p>

        <h3>GoogleDoc editing of 3D CAD models: Ongoing</h3>
        <p>This is my fourth year project, which has the implementation of web sockets in Javascript to provide a collaborative 3D CAD environment. I am implementing the client side of this project, which has most of the CAD environment.<br/><br/>
        Technologies used: Javascript, Three.js, HTML/CSS.</p>
        <h3>Unity Game: Call of Booty: October 2015</h3>
        <p>The project followed the RUP structure, with teams developing iteratively to allow testing of a prototype at each stage. My part in the project was to do with the forces being added to sprites through vector mathematics in C#.<br/><br/>
        Technologies used: C#, Unity.</p>
        <h3>Kiwifruit Orchard Simulation: August 2015</h3>
        <p>This project followed a more waterfall-like structure, with the process being repeated weekly. My part in the project was to design and implement the FSM logic for a picker robot, and to handle manual integration of peopleâ€™s code.<br/><br/>
        Technologies used: ros, C++.</p>
        <h3>Video and Audio Player/Editor:  October 2014</h3>
        <p>This was the first time I learned Git, which I have since used in all group projects. This project was written in Java and involved integration of the VLCJ library.<br/><br/>
        Technologies used: Java, VLCJ, Linux.</p>
        <h1>Programming Skills:</h1>
