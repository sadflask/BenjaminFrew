  				<h1>About Me</h1>

  				<h3>My Formal CV</h3>

  				<p>This is my CV as you would normally expect. It has a comprehensive list of my past projects, as well as a list of my skills. It also has my contact details, and a small section about me.</p>

  				<h3>My Informal CV</h3>

  				<p>This is a more wholesome CV for those who don't mind the informal. It has a slighty abridged list of my past projects, but focuses more on other aspects of me. These include my hobbies and soft skills, as well as a portfolio of my non-coding work.</p>
  				<h3>Minesweeper Game</h3>

  				<p>I have always been a fan of Minesweeper, and found creating this game to be an interesting challenge. Please note that this uses the Unity platform, and therefore is not supported by the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers.</p>

  				<h3>Space Arcade Game</h3>

  				<p>This game is one from Youtube tutorials, which used pre-provided assets to teach programmers how to use Unity. Please note that this uses the Unity platform, and therefore is not supported by the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers.</p>
