  				<h1>About Me</h1>

  				<h3>My Formal CV</h3>

  				<p>This is my CV as you would normally expect. It has a comprehensive list of my past projects, as well as a list of my skills. It also has my contact details, and a small section about me.</p>

  				<h3>My Informal CV</h3>

  				<p>This is a more wholesome CV for those who don't mind the informal. It has a slighty abridged list of my past projects, but focuses more on other aspects of me. These include my hobbies and soft skills, as well as a portfolio of my non-coding work.</p>
  				<h3>Curling Game</h3>

  				<p>This is the most technically difficult game i've ever attempted to make. For those not familiar with curling, the stone rotates as it travels down the ice, causing very complicated physics interactions. Unfortunately the science behind the result you see is highly debated, meaning that Unity can't handle this for the developer. This is the first game that i've decided to take to a deployable state as opposed to just trying to make something cool.</p>

  				<h3>Space Arcade Game</h3>

  				<p>This game is from the Global Game Jam 2017, that I made while in Dunedin in collaboration with 2 other programmers. Nearly all of the art it open sourced from the Unity Asset Store. The theme for games this year was waves, which we satisfied with the sine waves the player shoots and the waves of enemies. While the concept for the game is pretty simple, the product from 48 hours of work is something we were very happy with. </p>
